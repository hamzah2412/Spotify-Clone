Below is the preview image of Spotify-Clone. I learnt to do Context API (Redux), implement Material UI, using of Flexbox (CSS Styling), User Authentication and Spotify API. Used Spotify for Developers for Redirect URLs and Firebase for Deployment. Remember to add node modules (if you decide to clone). Remember to change the DirectUri of spotify.js after first deployment as well as your account on Spotify for Developers on Redirect URLs. Then run the build and reploy again.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm install`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Install node.js modules into folder.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
